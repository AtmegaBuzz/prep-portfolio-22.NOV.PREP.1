description: Hello! My name is Rose Allison, I am currently in my last semester at CUNY John Jay in NYC where I will be receiving a degree in Computer Science and Information Security. My passions in the technology world range from software development to data analytics to cybersecurity, but I have set my goals in cybersecurity for the most part. I am very enthusiastic about data security and implementing secure practices in day-to-day life as well as in all technical projects I work on. Upon my graduation in December, Iâ€™ll be transitioning into a Penetration Testing role where I hope to help enhance the security of other organizations.
